# A Knowledge Agent 

This is a versatile agent that utilizes a Large Language Model (LLM) with advanced reasoning capabilities to provide accurate and informative responses to a wide range of queries. The agent is equipped with four specialized tools:

RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generator): enabled by the NVIDIA RAG blueprint (https://github.com/NVIDIA-AI-Blueprints/rag), which allows for the upload of domain-specific PDF files, such as financial reports.

LLM: handles general questions and provides insightful responses.

WebSearch: powered by Tavily, provides up-to-date information on news and date-related queries.

Wikipedia: provides authoritative answers to questions on a vast range of topics.

When a query is received, the agent uses its reasoning capabilities to select the most suitable tool(s), analyse the answers, and generate a final answer.
